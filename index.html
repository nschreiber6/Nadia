        <h1>Hi, I'm Nadia!</h1>
        <p>I dream to live in a world where humans live in harmony with nature. A world where everyone follows their passions and enjoys life to the fullest. I dream to restore balance to the Earth.</p>
        <p>For the first 16 years of my life, gymnastics was my life.</p>
        <p>When I realized I wasn't meant to go to the olympics, I set my sights on a world that thrilled my imagination. The world of science and engineering.</p>
        <p>All the passion and energy I had for gymnastics was funneled into math and physics. I recieved my bachelors degree in computer engineering from the Colorado School of Mines in 2021.
        Coding can be applied to anything, so I continued on the path of 1s and 0s hoping passion would magically come. 
        When I graduated and worked at ALTEN Technologies, developing medical and aerospace devices, I loved learning about cool gadgets, but no passion for what I was building existed.
        This made me physically and mentally sick to the point that I was questioning existence. Rather then trying to claw my way up, I dug deeper, but in directions I had never been before.
        This led me to a magical passage where all the answers I was looking for flowed into me. I found my light within the darkness. That light is love and joy for where I am....</p>
        <h2>Mother Earth!!!</h2>
        <p>All my time and energy since that moment has been dedicated to healing the Earth. First that required learning what needed to be healed.</p>
        <p>    - Fossil fuels ain't helping. Imagine seeing your immenent death on the horizon and resisting even though it is harming yourself and everyone around you... That is what the fossil fuel industry has done for the past century. This will stop within this generation.</p>
        <p>    - Desertification: Land is drying up due to misuse of water resources, too much concrete, monocrop agriculture, the logging industry, and planting non-native.</p>
        <p>    - Glaciers are MELTING! - Greenhouse gasses trapping heat in our atmostphere. Fossil Fuels producing too much CO2. Loss of natural grazing and ranching - too many cows shoved into one barn, shitting and it not being composted releases Methane.</p>
        <p>    - Monopolies on food - When food is grown locally, using permaculture and native plants, it uses less water, and less energy to transport the food from the farm to the people.</p>
        <p>This led me to the many solutions we have and can begin acting on right now!</p>
        <p>    - Gardening or buying food from local organic, regenerative farmers. The majority of farms are not regenerative farms... yet. This is why I hope to be a farmer one day, among other things.</p>
        <p>    - Vote to stop subsidizing non-organic, monocrop farmers and giving fossil fuel companies tax breaks. This starts with voting for local representatives who are in tune with nature. If you're wondering how to tell, stop thinking about it and just feeeeeeeel.</p>
        <p>    - Plant native plants in your yard, get rid of stupid grass.</p>
        <p>    - Collect your rainwater and compost your food scraps.</p>
        <p>    - Stop buying from large companies.</p>
        <p>    - Everytime you eat, drink, or use something wonder where it came from and what it is made out of.</p>
        <p>    - Take care of your body, it does a lot for you. Give it a nice stretch and workout and eat some vegetables. No more refined sugar babes its so bad for you.</p>
        <p>    - Only do things that bring you joy and things you are proud of.</p>

        <h3>The Revelation</h3>
        <p>While learning about how to heal the Earth, I realized the importance of water. Water is life and we are so lucky to live on a planet that is abundant with it.</p>
        <p>This led me back to Colorado School of Mines to get a MS in Hydrologic Science and Engineering. If you're wondering why Mines again, I just love Golden and nerds so much... plus Clear Creek is magical.</p>
        <p>While taking classes that I truly love, I've found a passion for groundwater recharge. It fills me with pride and joy when I think of ways that we can restore the groundwater supply for future generations.</p>
        <p>The first step to groundwater recharge is developing a model to find the most efficient and cost effective way to fill deepest into the subsurface with the most amount of clean water.</p>
        <p>After the model, more funds can be allocated so that restoration plans can be developed and implemented.
        To learn more about the funds process and if models are truly useful, I interned at the EPA in the summer of 2024. I analyzed a subsetTribal Implementation Grants for the Puget Sound National Estuaries Program, Water Division.
        This helped me understand how grants are given and what makes a successful project: Detailed research that is input into various models to find the best restoration plan.</p>
        <p>After realizing the importance of an accurate and adaptable model, I went back to Mines to work on the NextGen Hydro Modeling Framework with Dr. Andy Wood. 
        This is what I am currently working on, and I am excited to help develop a model that can accuratly model many aspects of the water cycle and connect researchers all around the world.</p>
        <p>Well that's my entire life put into a few paragraphs. If you have passions that are aligned with mine and are interested in working with me, feel free to reach out!</p>
